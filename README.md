Little experiment with Socket.io

How to run:
cd into client -> npm i
cd into socket server -> npm i

/socket-server npm run start; runs the server (localhost port 9000)
/client ng s; runs the client (localhost port 4200)

You can now create a game room, join or leave one. With two players in a gameroom you can start a wordguesser game or tic-tac-toe.
